# Rising of the DevOps

For this project we try to create a CI/CD pipeline for a simple webapp. **GitHub Actions** would be a good choice to solve this task.
The task is ready when the build is green.

## Steps

1. We create a basic GitHub Actions workflow to run the lint test of my JavaScript app.

2. We fix the failing build

3. We create a Dockerfile which builds and runs the app without the uneccessary files and folders.

4. We modify the GitHub Actions workflow to build and push the Docker image to DockerHub.
  
## What are we going to learn?

- Create a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions workflow.
- Set running conditions for GitHub Actions workflow.
- Build a Docker image.
- Push the Docker image to image registry.
